```
These values look very reasonable. Looking at the curve going from colder at the earlier and later hours, while having higher temperatures at the middle of the day. November of 2013 was a very cold month in general, so having a prediction of +6 C is not unreasonable. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
predictions2 = rep(0,11)
k_distance <- gaussian_kernel(dist_hav,h_distance)
k_days <- gaussian_kernel(relative_day_dist(date,filtered_temps$date),h_date)



for (i in 1:length(temp)) {
  rel_h<-relative_hour_dist(times[i],filtered_temps$time)
  k_time <- gaussian_kernel(relative_hour_dist(times[i],filtered_temps$time),h_time)
  k_sum <- cbind(k_distance * k_days * k_time)
  k_sum <- (k_sum/sum(k_sum)) # Normalize the values in the k_sum matrix by dividing each element by the sum of the elements in each row
  weighted_temps <- k_sum * filtered_temps$air_temperature #get weighted temperatures
  
  predictions2[i] <- sum(weighted_temps)

  
}
plot(times_numbers,predictions2,type="o",xlab = "Time of day (hours)",ylab = "Predicted temp",main = "Prediction of temperature using mult")



```
This graph looks a bit more unclear. It's difficult to interpret if there's something wrong with how the data has been divided when multiplying, since the curve is not distributed like a bell curve. 

The reason for this graph being less "well distributed" is because the multiplied kernels will give more weight to the higher elements in the kernels, while suppressing the lower ones. This means that values that are not very close to the points we're looking at will not be considered nearly as much (even if they're already not being considered much). 

The summed kernel graph gives equal weights to all values which will give our predictions more "real" data to use, since values a bit further away from our initial ones will still be considered. In this case these values are very relevant, since weather predictions (more specifically, temperature predictions) require a lot of data, which should be distributed over time (and not only looking at the exact same day/time/location as what we're trying to predict).

# Questions

# 1. Which filter do we return to the user ? filter0, filter1, filter2 or filter3? Why?

The filter we return is filter1. Because the SVM model is trained on trianing data (tr) and validated on validation data (va). Then we should use the optimal err_va to make prediction on the test data. Using ksvm on training data and not any other. In general you do your training on your training set, evalutate its performance on the validation set, and then use the best model to predict on the test dataset. 

# 2. What is the estimate of the generalization error of the filter returned to the user? err0, err1, err2 or err3? Why?

it is err1 = 0.08489388. Filter0 gives low error estimate due to the fact that it is filtered on validation, the same way we choose the optimal err_va. Filter3 gives the lowest error estimate because of the the model is trained on the same data it is predicted on. As for filter1 and filter2, they give similar error estimates. Filter2 error rate is slightly lower due to the fact that it is trained on a larger data set (training and validation), where filter1 is only trained on training data.

# 3. Implementation of SVM predictions.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Get the indices of the support vectors in the SVM classifier
sv <- alphaindex(filter3)[[1]]

# Get the coefficients of the support vectors in the SVM classifier
co <- coef(filter3)[[1]]

# Get the bias term of the SVM classifier and negate it
inte <- -b(filter3)

# Create an RBF kernel with a standard deviation of 0.05
rbfkernel <- rbfdot(sigma = 0.05)

# Initialize an empty vector to store the predicted values
k <- c()

# Loop over the first 10 rows of the spam dataset
for(i in 1:10) { 
  
  # Initialize a variable to store the predicted value for the current row
  k2 <- 0
  
  # Loop over each support vector
  for(j in 1:length(sv)) {
    
    # Apply the RBF kernel to the jth support vector and the ith row of the spam dataset. We unlist the matrixes to perform the calculations.
    f <- rbfkernel(unlist(spam[sv[j], -58]), unlist(spam[i, -58]))
    
    # Update the predicted value for the current row by adding the product of the jth coefficient and the value of the kernel. F is a 1x1 matrix.
    k2 <- k2 + co[j] * f[1]
  }
  
  # Append the predicted value for the current row to the k vector
  k <- c(k, k2 + inte)
}

# Print the k vector
k

# Use the predict function to make predictions on the first 10 rows of the spam dataset using the trained SVM classifier
prediction = predict(filter3, spam[1:10, -58], type = "decision")

plot(k, col = "red")
lines(prediction)

```
The red dotted points is the predicted values that generated from the linear combination for filter3. The lines is the predictions from the predict function.

Task 3

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example :

1:
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)
set.seed(1234567890)
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
tr <- mydata[1:25,] # Training
te <- mydata[26:500,] # Test
winit = runif(31, -1,1) #weights: one for each of the 10 hidden nodes, plus one for the bias term for each of the 10 hidden nodes,
                        #plus one for the output node, plus one for the bias term for the output node

nn <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, startweights = winit)
# Plot of the training data (black), test data (blue), and predictions (red)
plot(tr, cex=2)
points(te, col = "blue", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn,te), col="red", cex=1)

```
Question: 
Train a neural network to learn the trigonometric sine function. To do so, sample 500
points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10]. Apply the sine function to each point.
The resulting value pairs are the data points available to you. Use 25 of the 500 points
for training and the rest for test. Use one hidden layer with 10 hidden units. You do
not need to apply early stopping. Plot the training and test data, and the predictions of
the learned NN on the test data. You should get good results. Comment your results.

Answer:
The predictions seems pretty accurate. We can se that there is less training data around the points where it kind of diverges from the testdata.
this is reasonoble and it then finds its way back.


2:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234567890)

# Generate data
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
tr <- mydata[1:25,] # Training
te <- mydata[26:500,] # Test
winit = runif(31, -1,1)

# Define custom activation functions
h1 <- function(x) x
h2 <- function(x) ifelse(x>0,x,0)
h3 <- function(x) log(1 + exp(x))

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn1 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h1, startweights = winit)

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn2 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h2, startweights = winit)

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn3 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h3, startweights = winit)

# Plot results
plot(tr, cex=3, ylim=c(-1.5, 1.5))
points(te, col = "blue", cex=2)
points(te[,1],predict(nn1,te), col="red", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn2,te), col="green", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn3,te), col="pink", cex=1)
legend(1, -0.5, legend=c("train", "test","linear", "ReLu", "Softplus"),
       col=c("black","blue","red", "green", "pink"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8)

```
Question:
 In question (1), you used the default logistic (a.k.a. sigmoid) activation function, i.e.
act.fct = "logistic". Repeat question (1) with the following custom activation
functions: h1(x) = x, h2(x) = max{0, x} and h3(x) = ln(1 + exp x) (a.k.a. linear, ReLU
and softplus). See the help file of the neuralnet package to learn how to use custom
activation functions. Plot and comment your results.

Answer:
The third custom activation softplus seems to fit the best. while the first, linear is very bad and the second, ReLu manages
predict some values.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)
set.seed(1234567890)
Var <- runif(500, 0, 50)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))


# Plot of the training data (black), test data (blue), and predictions (red)

prediction = predict(nn,mydata)

plot(mydata, col = "blue", cex=1, ylim=c(-15, 2), xlim=c(0, 55))
points(mydata[,1],prediction, col="red", cex=1, )


smallestIndex = which.min(prediction)

smallestvalue = prediction[smallestIndex]

Question:
Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,50], and apply the sine function to each point. Use the NN learned in question (1) to predict the sine function value
for these new 500 points. You should get mixed results. Plot and comment your results.

Answer:
The predictions seem to still be accurate to the data up to Var 10, and after that it converges to -10.74471 up to Var=50.


4:

Question:
 In question (3), the predictions seem to converge to some value. Explain why this
happens. To answer this question, you may need to get access to the weights of the
NN learned. You can do it by running nn or nn$weights where nn is the NN learned.

Answer:
The predictions seem to still be accurate to the data up to Var 10, and after that it converges to -10.74471 at Var=50.
The nn is only trained of var values between 0-10 but attempts to predict 0-50. Same for the hidden units.
Not sure why it converges to exactly -10.74.


5:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10]
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)

# Apply the sine function to each point
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
otherWayData <- data.frame(Sin=sin(Var), Var)

winit = runif(31, 0,10)

# Use all these points as training points

# Set the target variable to be Var instead of Sin
nn <- neuralnet(Var ~ Sin, data = mydata, hidden = 10, threshold = 0.1, startweights = winit )

# Plot the predictions of the neural network
plot(te, col = "blue", cex=1,ylim=c(-10, 10), xlim=c(0, 10))
points(tr[,1],predict(nn,tr), col="red", cex=1)

plot(otherWayData,col = "blue", cex=1) #kanske borde plotta enligt gamla training data istÃ¤llet?
points(otherWayData[,1],predict(nn,otherWayData), col="red", cex=1)
```
Question:
 Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10], and apply the sine function to each point. Use all these points as training points for learning a NN that tries
to predict x from sin(x), i.e. unlike before when the goal was to predict sin(x) from
x. Use the learned NN to predict the training data. You should get bad results. Plot
and comment your results. Help: Some people get a convergence error in this question. It can be solved by stopping the training before reaching convergence by setting
threshold = 0.1.


Answer:
Looks very bad, it is reasonable because we are trying to map from multiple values and not a clear function. 
One sin value corresponds to multiple var values which makes it impossible to predict.
It kinda finds an avarage.
