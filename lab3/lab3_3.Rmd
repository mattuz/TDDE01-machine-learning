## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)
set.seed(1234567890)
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
tr <- mydata[1:25,] # Training
te <- mydata[26:500,] # Test
winit = runif(31, -1,1) #weights: one for each of the 10 hidden nodes, plus one for the bias term for each of the 10 hidden nodes,
                        #plus one for the output node, plus one for the bias term for the output node

nn <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, startweights = winit)
# Plot of the training data (black), test data (blue), and predictions (red)
plot(tr, cex=2)
points(te, col = "blue", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn,te), col="red", cex=1)

```
Question: 
Train a neural network to learn the trigonometric sine function. To do so, sample 500
points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10]. Apply the sine function to each point.
The resulting value pairs are the data points available to you. Use 25 of the 500 points
for training and the rest for test. Use one hidden layer with 10 hidden units. You do
not need to apply early stopping. Plot the training and test data, and the predictions of
the learned NN on the test data. You should get good results. Comment your results.

Answer:
The predictions seems pretty accurate.


2:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234567890)

# Generate data
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
tr <- mydata[1:25,] # Training
te <- mydata[26:500,] # Test
winit = runif(31, -1,1)

# Define custom activation functions
h1 <- function(x) x
h2 <- function(x) ifelse(x>0,x,0)
h3 <- function(x) log(1 + exp(x))

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn1 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h1, startweights = winit)

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn2 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h2, startweights = winit)

# Train neural network with custom activation functions
nn3 <- neuralnet(Sin ~ Var, data = tr,
                hidden = 10, act.fct = h3, startweights = winit)

# Plot results
plot(tr, cex=3, ylim=c(-1.5, 1.5))
points(te, col = "blue", cex=2)
points(te[,1],predict(nn1,te), col="red", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn2,te), col="green", cex=1)
points(te[,1],predict(nn3,te), col="pink", cex=1)

```
Question:
 In question (1), you used the default logistic (a.k.a. sigmoid) activation function, i.e.
act.fct = "logistic". Repeat question (1) with the following custom activation
functions: h1(x) = x, h2(x) = max{0, x} and h3(x) = ln(1 + exp x) (a.k.a. linear, ReLU
and softplus). See the help file of the neuralnet package to learn how to use custom
activation functions. Plot and comment your results.

Answer:
The third custom activation seems to fit the best.

3:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(neuralnet)
set.seed(1234567890)
Var <- runif(500, 0, 50)
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))


# Plot of the training data (black), test data (blue), and predictions (red)

prediction = predict(nn,mydata)

plot(mydata, col = "blue", cex=1, ylim=c(-15, 2), xlim=c(0, 55))
points(mydata[,1],prediction, col="red", cex=1, )


smallestIndex = which.min(prediction)

smallestvalue = prediction[smallestIndex]

nn$weights

smallestvalue


```
Question:
Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,50], and apply the sine function to each point. Use the NN learned in question (1) to predict the sine function value
for these new 500 points. You should get mixed results. Plot and comment your results.

Answer:
The predictions seem to still be accurate to the data up to Var 10.


4:

Question:
 In question (3), the predictions seem to converge to some value. Explain why this
happens. To answer this question, you may need to get access to the weights of the
NN learned. You can do it by running nn or nn$weights where nn is the NN learned.

Answer:
The predictions seem to still be accurate to the data up to Var 10, and after that it converges to -10.74471 at Var=50.

5:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10]
Var <- runif(500, 0, 10)

# Apply the sine function to each point
mydata <- data.frame(Var, Sin=sin(Var))
otherWayData <- data.frame(Sin=sin(Var), Var)

winit = runif(31, 0,10)

# Use all these points as training points
tr <- mydata

# Set the target variable to be Var instead of Sin
nn <- neuralnet(Var ~ Sin, data = tr, hidden = 10, threshold = 0.1, startweights = winit )

# Plot the predictions of the neural network
plot(tr, col = "blue", cex=1,ylim=c(-10, 10), xlim=c(0, 10))
points(tr[,1],predict(nn,tr), col="red", cex=1)

plot(otherWayData,col = "blue", cex=1) #kanske borde plotta engligt gamla training data istÃ¤llet?
points(otherWayData[,1],predict(nn,otherWayData), col="red", cex=1)
```
Question:
 Sample 500 points uniformly at random in the interval [0,10], and apply the sine function to each point. Use all these points as training points for learning a NN that tries
to predict x from sin(x), i.e. unlike before when the goal was to predict sin(x) from
x. Use the learned NN to predict the training data. You should get bad results. Plot
and comment your results. Help: Some people get a convergence error in this question. It can be solved by stopping the training before reaching convergence by setting
threshold = 0.1.


Answer:
Looks very bad, it is reasonable because i am trying to map from multiple values and not a clear function. 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
